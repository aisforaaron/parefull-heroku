Welcome to the Parefull API docs!
These are the public endpoints available for use.
Some paths use JWT since they are admin or utility only.

Notes
- You can use Postman to test the API with this <a href="docs/config/Parefull.json.postman_collection">Postman collection file</a>
- Staging and Development API urls are different than what is listed in the main API docs.
- Please submit any questions/comments as emails to aarondllc@gmail.com

API dependencies
